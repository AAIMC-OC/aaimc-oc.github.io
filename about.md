Our consortium brings together leading researchers, clinicians, and data scientists from prestigious institutions in Europe, Asia and Africa. We aim to develop and, more importantly, implement new ways to evaluate ovarian cancer molecular characteristics using artificial intelligence to support clinicians making treatment decisions globally.

## Our Mission

Our overarching goal is to develop ways to apply AI-defined molecular classifications globally

## Our Research Objectives

To develop and implement innovative AI-driven approaches for better understanding and classifying ovarian cancer at the molecular level for personalised care
To collate a database of paired images of H&E-stained tumour slides using high-cost whole slide scanners (gold standard) and a range of low-cost imaging techniques to compare AI model flexibility 
To establish a privacy-preserving federated learning platform to reduce barriers to compare different AI approaches on the same multi-institutional datasets and future clinical implementation 

## Research Focus Areas

- AI-driven molecular classification
- Digital pathology
- Ovarian cancer biology
- Translational research

## Current Research Funding

This work is funded by the US Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programmes (CDMRP) FY23 Ovarian Cancer Research Programme Award (OC230126).
