The Application of AI-defined Molecular Classifications in Ovarian Cancer (AAIMC-OC) Consortium brings together leading researchers, clinicians, and data scientists from prestigious institutions in Europe, Asia and Africa.

We aim to develop and, more importantly, **implement** new ways to evaluate ovarian cancer molecular characteristics using artificial intelligence to support clinicians making treatment decisions globally.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to develop ways to apply AI-defined molecular classifications globally

<br>

## Research Focus Areas

- AI-driven molecular classification
- Federated Learning 
- Digital pathology implementation in different resource settings
- Ovarian cancer biology
- Translational cancer research
