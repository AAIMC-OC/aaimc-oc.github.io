The Application of AI-defined Molecular Classifications in Ovarian Cancer (AAIMC-OC) Consortium brings together leading researchers, clinicians, and data scientists from prestigious institutions in Europe, Asia and Africa. We aim to develop and, more importantly, implement new ways to evaluate ovarian cancer molecular characteristics using artificial intelligence to support clinicians making treatment decisions globally.

## Our Mission

Our overarching goal is to develop ways to apply AI-defined molecular classifications globally

## Research Focus Areas

- AI-driven molecular classification
- Digital pathology
- Ovarian cancer biology
- Translational research

## Current Research Funding

This work is funded by the US Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programmes (CDMRP) FY23 Ovarian Cancer Research Programme Award (OC230126).
