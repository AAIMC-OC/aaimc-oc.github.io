# AAIMC-OC Consortium

Welcome to the official webpage of the Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Classification of Ovarian Cancer (AAIMC-OC) consortium. We are a collaborative group dedicated to advancing ovarian cancer research through AI-driven molecular classification and international collaboration.

## About Us

Our consortium brings together leading researchers, clinicians, and data scientists from prestigious institutions across Europe and Asia. We aim to revolutionize ovarian cancer classification and treatment through the integration of artificial intelligence, molecular profiling, and clinical expertise.

## Our Mission

To develop and implement innovative AI-driven approaches for better understanding and classifying ovarian cancer at the molecular level. Through international collaboration, we seek to improve patient outcomes by enabling more precise and personalized treatment strategies.
