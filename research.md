## Our hypothesis

Established AI algorithms can determine Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) and other molecular characteristics of ovarian tumours from H&E-stained histology images obtained using high-resolution slide scanners and low-cost imaging systems from different healthcare facilities in different parts of the world with no difference in model performance.

<br>

## Our first objectives

- To refine AI algorithms to evaluate HRD and other molecular characteristics in ovarian cancer from H&E whole-slide images (WSIs) using a multinational dataset
- To generate a matched cohort of images using different imaging systems and at different magnifications relevant for different resources settings to evaluate model flexibility of the established AI algorithms
- To evaluate the feasibility to implement AI-defined molecular tests in poor-resource settings using a privacy-preserving federated learning platform
